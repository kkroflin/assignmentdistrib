Description
-----------
Assignment Distribution is an activity module for Moodle (1.9) that can be used
for assigning different assignments to different students or to groups of
students. In the individual mode, the assignments can be assigned randomly or
the students can choose the assignments from the list. In the group assignment
mode, the students form groups by themselves or the teacher forms them.
 
Each assignment's parameters include the minimum and the maximum number of
students in a group. In the individual mode those parameters are ignored. 

When grading a group, the teacher can choose to grade only the group or also
grade each student individually. If the teacher grades only the group, the team
leader can grade all students in the group but the average grade of the group
can't be greater than the group grade.

Disclaimer
----------
The module is compatible only with Moodle 1.9 (MySQL is also required) and
currently there are no plans for updating it, but feel free to use the ideas
that you may find interesting in your modules or even update this module for
Moodle 2.x support :)

Known issues
------------
* Works only in Moodle 1.9 with MySQL as database
* Some of the string are hardcoded in English
